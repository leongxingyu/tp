### Architecture

![Architecture Diagram](images/ArchitectureDiagram.png)

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

[**`StockPal`**](https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2113T-T09-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/stockpal/StockPal.java) is
in charge of the app launch and shut down.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following five components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Parser`**](#parser-component): Parses user input into respective commands.
* [**`Command`**](#command-component): The command executor.
* [**`Data`**](#data-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple components above.
[**`Exceptions`**](#exception-classes) represents a collection of exceptions used by multiple components above.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

![Architecture Sequence Diagram](images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png)

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2113T-T09-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/stockpal/ui/Ui.java).

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI component,

* gets user input from the user, and returns it to `StockPal` component for parsing and execution of respective
  commands.
* waits on the `Command` component as the commands will be calling the UI to print messages.
* depends on the `Command` component, as it is required by the respective commands to output specified messages.

### Parser component

**API** : [`Parser.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2113T-T09-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/stockpal/parser/Parser.java)

![Structure of the Parser Component](images/ParserClassDiagram.png)

How the `Parser` component works:

1. When user inputs, the input is passed to the `Parser`.
2. `Parser` first extracts the command.
3. Using the extracted command, `Parser` will perform different validation checks on the arguments supplied in the
   input, iteratively.

   For example, `edit 1 n/newName q/100` will be checked in the order: Command name: `edit`, PID: `1`, Name: `newName`,
   Quantity: `100`, Price: `null`, and lastly Description: `null`.
4. Arguments (mainly the `pid`, `name`, `quantity`, `price`, `description`, `amount` fields) are validated.
   Exceptions are thrown when the fields do not pass their respective type checks.
5. Once validation passes, `Parser` uses the validated arguments to creates an instance of that particular command.
   For example, a `delete` command will cause `Parser` to create a new instance of `DeleteCommand(pid)`.
6. The created command object is returned back to `main` function for further processing.

### Command component

**API
** : [`Command.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2113T-T09-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/stockpal/commands/Command.java)

![Structure of the Command Component](images/CommandClassDiagram.png)

How the `Command` component works:

1. `Parser` first creates the respective `Command` after parsing user input. Then, the `Command` is passed
   to `StockPal`, awaiting execution.
2. `StockPal` then executes the respective `Command`.
3. After execution, be it successful or unsuccessful, `Command` calls on the `UI` component to output the results to
   screen.

### Data component

**API** : [`Data`](https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2113T-T09-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/stockpal/data)

The following is a class diagram of the `Data` component.

![Structure of the Data Component](images/DataClassDiagram.png)

The `Data` component,

* stores StockPal's data i.e., all `Product` objects (which are contained in a `ProductList` object) and
  all `Transaction` objects (which are contained in a `TransactionList` object).
* does not depend on any of the other components (as the `Data` represents data entities of the domain, they should make
  sense on their own without depending on other components).

### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage`](https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2113T-T09-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/stockpal/storage/)

![Structure of the Storage Component](images/StorageClassDiagram.png)

The `Storage` component,

* can save product list data in CSV format, and load them back into corresponding Products.
* depends on the `StockPal` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/load objects that belong
  to `StockPal`)
* consists of the classes `Storage`, `CsvWriter` and `CsvReader`.
    * `Storage` defines methods that loads and saves product data.
    * `CsvWriter` is responsible for handling the writing of product data to the CSV data file.
    * `CsvReader` is responsible for handling the reading of product data from the CSV data file.

In addition to saving products, the `Storage` component has a subcomponent `TransactionStorage`, which

* can save transaction list data in JSON format, and load them back into corresponding Transactions.
* also depends on the `StockPal` component.
* consists of the `TransactionStorage`, `JsonWriter` and `JsonReader`.
    * `TransactionStorage` defines methods that loads and saves transaction data.
    * `JsonWriter` is responsible for handling the writing of transaction data to the JSON data file.
    * `JsonReader` is responsible for handling the reading of transaction data from the JSON data file.

### Common Classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.stockpal.common` package.
The `common` package consists of 2 useful utility classes that are mainly used for printing of output to screen, as well
as containing the output messages.

### Exception Classes

Exception classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.stockpal.exceptions` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Command Feature

The following sequence diagram summarizes what happens when a user inputs a valid command.

<img src="images/CommandSequenceDiagram.png" alt="images/CommandSequenceDiagram.png"/>


Validation of the user input is done in `Parser`, hence `XYZCommand` assumes that all fields provided upon creation of a `XYZCommand` object are properly formatted.

The `execute()` method of each command will be elaborated further with the introduction of each of the features below.

### Help Feature

**Implementation**

The `help` command is used to display the help page for either all or individual commands.

The `help` feature is facilitated by `HelpCommand` which extends `Command`.

Details for individual commands are stored within the individual classes as static variables.
The details are stored as 5 variables as follows.

| Variable                  | What it represents                                    | Example                                                         |
|---------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| COMMAND_KEYWORD           | The keyword used to identify the command.             | "inflow"                                                        |
| COMMAND_DESCRIPTION       | Description of the command.                           | "Increases the quantity of a product from the existing amount." |
| COMMAND_USAGE             | The format of the command.                            | "inflow PID a/INCREMENT_AMOUNT"                                 |
| COMMAND_FLAGS             | Placeholder value used to denote command arguments.   | {"PID", "INCREMENT_AMOUNT"}                                     |
| COMMAND_FLAG_DESCRIPTIONS | Description of what the placeholder value represents. | {"Product ID of product", "Quantity of product to add"}         |

`FormatUtils#formatCommandDetails()` takes in these 5 variables as arguments and produces a formatted version of the details.

Example of formatted version of details based on the 5 example variables above:

```
====================================================================================
Command: inflow

Description: Increases the quantity of a product from the existing amount.

Usage: inflow PID a/INCREMENT_AMOUNT

Options:
PID                   Product ID of product
INCREMENT_AMOUNT      Quantity of product to add
====================================================================================
```

Each command has a public static `commandDetails()` method that will return the formatted version of its command details.

**Design Considerations**

Aspect: Where to store the individual command details.

- Alternative 1 (current choice): Command details are stored in each individual command. Access the details via a static `commandDetails` method.
    - Pros:
        - Easy for developers to maintain the details for the command that they are working on.
    - Cons:
        - Declaring `commandDetails` method for all commands is quite repetitive.
- Alternative 2: Command details are stored in each individual command. Access the details via an inherited `commandDetails` method (all commands inherits from `Command`).
    - Pros:
        - Easy for developers to maintain the details for the command that they are working on.
        - Only need to implement `commandDetails` method once in the parent class `Command`.
        - Loop can be used to print all command details.
    - Cons:
        - Requires an instance of the command to be created to call the `commandDetails` method, hence all commands will require a constructor that takes in no parameters.
        - Must ensure that the command instance is solely used to call the `commandDetails` method. Otherwise, an error will occur.
- Alternative 3:  Store all command details within `HelpCommand`
    - Pros:
        - Everything related to `help` will be in one file.
    - Cons:
        - Cluttered to have all command details on the same page.
        - Harder for developers to maintain the details for the command that they are working on.
        - Code looks very long and repetitive with `FormatUtils.formatCommandDetails(COMMAND_KEYWORD, COMMAND_DESCRIPTION , COMMAND_USAGE, COMMAND_FLAGS, COMMAND_FLAG_DESCRIPTIONS)` being called for every single command.

### New Product Feature

The `new` command is responsible for adding a new product to the inventory in the StockPal application.

The new product feature is facilitated by `NewCommand` which extends `ListActionCommand`.

Specific validations are still carried out within `NewCommand`.

1. Checking if the new product name is the same as an existing product name.

Once all validation is completed, adding of product is done by calling `ProductList#newProduct()`.

The following sequence diagram details how `NewCommand#execute()` functions.

<img src="images/AddCommandExecuteSequenceDiagram.png" alt="AddCommandExecuteSequenceDiagram.png"/>

### Edit Product Feature

**Implementation**

The `edit` command is used to edit product details such as name, quantity, price and description.

The edit product feature is facilitated by `EditCommand` which extends `ListActionCommand`.

Specific validations are still carried out when updating the product details.

1. Checking if at least 1 field (name, quantity, price or description) is provided.
2. Checking if the product ID (PID) belongs to an existing product.
3. Checking if the edited product name is the same as an existing product name.

Updating of product details is done by calling `ProductList#updateProduct()`.

The following sequence diagram details how `EditCommand#execute()` functions.

<img src="images/EditCommandExecuteSequenceDiagram.png" alt="EditCommandExecuteSequenceDiagram.png"/>

### List Feature

The `list` command is responsible for sorting and printing out the products in the list.

The list feature is facilitated by `ListCommand` which extends `ListActionCommand`.

**Attributes**

* sortType: Additional optional flags the user can set to sort the products in the list.

**Methods**

* `ListCommand`: Constructor for creating a new instance of the ListCommand class.
* `execute`: Method to list out the products in the product list.
* `sortListAccordingly`: Method to sort the list according to the products' PID, products' name or products' quantity.

The following sequence diagram illustrates how `ListCommand#execute()` functions.

<img src="images/ListCommandExecuteSequenceDiagram.png" alt="ListCommandExecuteSequenceDiagram.png"/>

### InflowCommand Feature

The `inflow` command is used to increase the quantity of a specific product in the inventory.
This could represent scenarios like receiving new stock and updating inventory with new quantities.

**Implementation**

The inflow product feature is facilitated by `InflowCommand` which extends `TransactionActionCommand`.

Specific validations are still carried out within the `InflowCommand`.

1. Checking if the product ID (PID) belongs to an existing product.
2. Checking if the addition of inflow quantity and existing quantity will result in an integer overflow.

Once all validations are completed, increasing a product quantity is done by
calling `ProductList#increaseAmountCaller()`.

The following sequence diagram shows how the InflowCommand works. <br><br>
![InflowCommand Class](images/InflowCommandSequence.png)

### OutflowCommand Feature

The `outflow` command is used to decrease the quantity of a specific product in the inventory.
This could represent scenarios like selling products and updating inventory with new updated quantities.

**Implementation**

The outflow product feature is facilitated by `OutflowCommand` which extends `TransactionActionCommand`.

Specific validations are still carried out within the `OutflowCommand`.

1. Checking if the product ID (PID) belongs to an existing product.
2. Checking if the outflow quantity is larger than the existing quantity.

Once all validations are completed, decreasing a product quantity is done by
calling `ProductList#decreaseAmountCaller()`.

The following sequence diagram shows how the InflowCommand works. <br><br>
![OutflowCommand Class](images/OutflowCommandSequence.png)

### Delete product feature

The `delete` command is used to delete a product of the specified `PID` in the inventory.

**Implementation**

The delete product feature is mainly facilitated by `DeleteCommand` which extends `TransactionActionCommand`.

**Attributes**

`PID` The unique Product ID for the product to be deleted from the StockPal inventory `productList`.

**Methods**

* `DeleteCommand`: Constructor for creating a new instance of the DeleteCommand class.
* `execute`: Method to delete `Product` with PID `PID` from StockPal's `productList`.
* `ProductList#deleteProduct`: Method called by `execute` to delete product in `productList`.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the delete function behaves at each step. The scenario assumes that the
user has a `Product` with `PID` of 2 in `StockPal`'s `productList`.

Step 1. The user executes `delete 2` command to delete a specific `Product` with `PID` of 2.
Step 2. The product is successfully deleted from the inventory list.

**Possible Exceptions that can be thrown**

* PidNotFoundException: Thrown when user-supplied `PID` does not correspond to any of the products in the inventory
  currently.

The following sequence diagram shows how `DeleteCommand#execute()` functions. The sequence diagram assumes that `PID`
provided is valid.

![DeleteCommandSequenceDiagram](images/DeleteCommandSequence.png)

### Find product feature

The `find` command is responsible for finding a particular keyword
in a product's name in the StockPal application.

The find product feature is facilitated by `FindCommand` which extends `ListActionCommand`.

Finding of keyword of product is done by calling `ProductList#FindKeyword()`.

The following sequence diagram details how `FindCommand#execute()` functions.

<img src="images/FindCommandExecuteSequenceDiagram.png" alt="FindCommandExecuteSequenceDiagram.png"/>

### History product feature

The `history` command is responsible for finding any inflows or outflows for a particular `PID` in the StockPal application.

The history product feature is facilitated by `HistoryCommand` which extends `TransactionActionCommand`.

Finding of transactions is done by calling `ProductList#FindTransactions()`.

The following sequence diagram details how `HistoryCommand#execute()` functions.

<img src="images/HistoryCommandExecuteSequenceDiagram.png" alt="HistoryCommandExecuteSequenceDiagram.png"/>

## **Appendix: Requirements**

### Product scope

**Target user profile**:

* Small business owners who are looking to keep track of their inventory using CLI
* Possibly established companies looking to expand our application

**Value proposition**: <br>
Traditional inventory management methods often involve manual data entry, spreadsheets, and paper-based
tracking systems. These processes are time-consuming, error-prone, and lack real-time visibility into
inventory status. StockPal allows users to quickly update, track, and monitor inventory data through
intuitive command-line commands, saving time and improving efficiency.
